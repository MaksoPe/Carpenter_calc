Board_calculator.py is a simple program that will calculate out the material needed for framing, since it only calculates with lengths it can be used for both metric and imperial.
To change it to imperial just change the: raw_material and calculated_waste variables, and you are able use the cutlist with inch lengths to calculate the amount of 2X material.
